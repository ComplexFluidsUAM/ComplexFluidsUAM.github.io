This is the first entry of the VQCM blog, where you will see the latest news about our research and development efforts.  

## Presenting VQCM  

Researchers are currently engaged in the design of new biosensors, many of which are based on the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). To develop these technologies, which will lead to a whole range of new applications (from early detection of many types of cancer to the study of the properties of complex materials) it is necessary to first disentangle how biomolecules interact with the sensors.

Our V-QCM technology emerged initially in the context of a European project named Catch-U-DNA, where we collaborated with experimental groups and scientific instruments manufacturers with the intention of designing devices that allowed us to diagnose several types of cancer by means of the detection of minuscule concentrations of DNA in blood samples.

Our theoretical analyses revealed that the relation between measured signals and the microscopic behaviour of biomolecules is not yet well understood. The relation is complex because the forces among molecules, the vibrations, configurations and, especially, the motion of the surrounding fluids have an effect on the resulting QCM signal.

Thanks to our work, with V-QCM we can now quantitatively reproduce the result of several QCM measurements. A significant fraction of our recent publications focus on this progress. Our methods allow us to better understand the interactions between molecules and the microbalance, and we can use this knowledge to assist in the interpretation of data and the design of new technologies.

To connect the microscopic phenomena with the final measurement, we use high-performance computing and advanced fluctuating hydrodynamics algorithms developed only recently. Using these advances, we rigorously simulate and visualise the world at the nanoscale.

The biosensors of the future are being designed today, and there are many researchers trying to find out how to use microscopic interactions to their advantage to design new technologies. To help them, we have designed V-QCM,
an advanced simulation system that makes sense of QCM measurements.

[//]: # ## Textbook definition
[//]: # 
[//]: # A textbook definition is: "The direct personal presentation, demonstration, and sale of products and services to consumers, usually in their homes or at their jobs."
[//]: # 
[//]: # ## How effective is direct selling?
[//]: # 
[//]: # Industry representative, the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations (WFDSA), reports that its 59 regional member associations accounted for more than US$183 billion in retail sales in 2014, through the activities of more than 62 million independent sales representatives. The United States Direct Selling Association (DSA) reported that in 2000, 55% of adult Americans had at some time purchased goods or services from a direct selling representative and 20% reported that they were currently(6%) or had been in the past(14%) a direct selling representative.

[//]: # According to the WFDSA, consumers benefit from direct selling because of the convenience and service it provides, including personal demonstration and explanation of products, home delivery, and generous satisfaction guarantees. In contrast to franchising, the cost for an individual to start an independent direct selling business is typically very low with little or no required inventory or other cash commitments to begin.
[//]: # 
[//]: # Most direct selling associations around the world require their members to abide by a code of conduct towards a fair partnership both with customers and salesmen...
[//]: # 
[//]: # Most national direct selling associations are represented in the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations (WFDSA).

[//]: # ## How's it different to marketing?
[//]: # 
[//]: # Direct selling is distinct from direct marketing because it is about individual sales agents reaching and dealing directly with clients. Direct marketing is about business organizations seeking a relationship with their customers without going through an agent/consultant or retail outlet.
[//]: # 
[//]: # Direct selling consists of two main business models: single-level marketing, in which a direct seller makes money by buying products from a parent organization and selling them directly to customers, and multi-level marketing (also known as network marketing or person-to-person marketing), in which the direct seller makes money from both direct sales to customers and by sponsoring new direct sellers and earning a commission from their efforts.
