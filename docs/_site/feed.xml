&lt;h2 id=&quot;presenting-vqcm&quot;&gt;Presenting VQCM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are currently engaged in the design of new biosensors, many of which are based on the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). To develop these technologies, which will lead to a whole range of new applications (from early detection of many types of cancer to the study of the properties of complex materials) it is necessary to first disentangle how biomolecules interact with the sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our V-QCM technology emerged initially in the context of a European project named Catch-U-DNA, where we collaborated with experimental groups and scientific instruments manufacturers with the intention of designing devices that allowed us to diagnose several types of cancer by means of the detection of minuscule concentrations of DNA in blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our theoretical analyses revealed that the relation between measured signals and the microscopic behaviour of biomolecules is not yet well understood. The relation is complex because the forces among molecules, the vibrations, configurations and, especially, the motion of the surrounding fluids have an effect on the resulting QCM signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our work, with V-QCM we can now quantitatively reproduce the result of several QCM measurements. A significant fraction of our recent publications focus on this progress. Our methods allow us to better understand the interactions between molecules and the microbalance, and we can use this knowledge to assist in the interpretation of data and the design of new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect the microscopic phenomena with the final measurement, we use high-performance computing and advanced fluctuating hydrodynamics algorithms developed only recently. Using these advances, we rigorously simulate and visualise the world at the nanoscale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biosensors of the future are being designed today, and there are many researchers trying to find out how to use microscopic interactions to their advantage to design new technologies. To help them, we have designed V-QCM,
an advanced simulation system that makes sense of QCM measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><summary type="html">This is the first entry of the VQCM blog, where you will see the latest news about our research and development efforts.</summary></entry></feed>
