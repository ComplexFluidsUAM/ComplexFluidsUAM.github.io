	<h2>Universally Adaptable Multiscale Molecular Dynamics (UAMMD)</h2>
	<p>
	  Developed by Raul P. Pelaez as part of his PhD. studies, UAMMD is a generic multiscale modelling code running on NVIDIA Graphical processors.
	  UAMMD can simulate the dynamics of millions of particles submerged in fluids on multiple spatio-temporal scales, including molecular dynamics, brownian dynamics, fluctuating hydrodynamics and more!
	  UAMMD is open source and presented with a GPL license, you can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/RaulPPelaez/UAMMD">github</a>.
	  Now UAMMD is used in several research groups all around the world and it is being actively developed by Raul and the rest of the complex fluids team.
